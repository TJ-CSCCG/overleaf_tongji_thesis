# :page_facing_up: Overleaf-Compatible Undergraduate Thesis Template (Tongji Univ.)

English | [ä¸­æ–‡](README.md)

**NOTE**:

* Till May 26th, 2021, our "great"ðŸ™„ `1.tongji.edu` is not able to support uploading `.pdf` files (but only MS Word files). But you may simply convert the generated PDF to `docx` using some online tools (e.g., [pdf2go.pdf-to-word](https://www.pdf2go.com/pdf-to-word))
* But no worries, many students and [I](https://github.com/ganler) still graduated successfully using this template. So word with what you like!

## Use it on **Overleaf** NOW!

**CLICK ME** ðŸ‘‰ [![svg of overleaf-tongjithesis](https://img.shields.io/badge/overleaf-tongjithesis-green.svg)](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/tongji-undergrad-thesis/dfdvqsmpfcgk)

Note that **the overleaf template might not be up-to-date** so it is suggested to create your own overleaf project manually (see the [section](#use-latest-version-on-overleaf) below).

**NOTICE!** Check **Compiler** and **Main document** you use in overleaf settings:

* Please select `main.tex` as the main file. Other files except `main.tex` should not be the value of main document option.
* Please compile it with `XeLaTeX` (suggested) or some other supported compiler (e.g. `pdfLaTeX` is **NOT** supported).

## Use latest version on Overleaf

* Download this repo `Code | Download ZIP`;
* Open [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/);
* Click upload project and drag the `.zip` file into Overleaf panel;
